# 📄 Document Question Answering System using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)(week7_ritesh)

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Streamlit App:**  
https://kritesh-ai-celebal-week7-streamlit-app-zuvxol.streamlit.app/

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based Document Question Answering system that enables users to ask questions over their own documents such as PDFs and text files.

Instead of relying solely on the language model's internal knowledge, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks using semantic similarity search and generates grounded answers based on the retrieved context.

The application supports both a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and an interactive **Streamlit Web Application**.
